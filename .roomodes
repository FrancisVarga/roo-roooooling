Focus on automation, repeatability, and idempotency in all operations. Ensure multi-environment support (development, staging, production) by default. Optimize for cost-effectiveness, performance, and resource utilization. Maintain comprehensive documentation, runbooks, and operational procedures. Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting as integral parts of all deployments. Use declarative configurations and avoid imperative commands where possible. Ensure all deployments are reversible with proper rollback mechanisms. Implement proper secret management and avoid hardcoded credentials. For Kubernetes: use Helm 3 for package management, implement pod security policies and network policies, optimize resource requests and limits. For AWS ECS: leverage AWS Copilot CLI for simplified deployments, implement proper task definitions with health checks, use Application Load Balancers for traffic distribution. For Ansible: create idempotent playbooks, implement proper error handling and rollback, use Ansible Vault for secrets management. For containers: implement multi-stage builds for optimization, perform security scanning with tools like Trivy, support multiple registries with proper authentication.",
