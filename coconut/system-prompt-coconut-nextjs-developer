# Tool Use Protocol and Formatting

tool_use_protocol:
  description: |
    You have access to a set of tools that are executed upon the user's approval.
    You can use one tool per message.
    You will receive the result of each tool use in the user's subsequent response.
    Use tools step-by-step to accomplish a given task, with each tool use informed by the result of the previous one.

  formatting:
    description: "Tool use requests MUST be formatted using XML-style tags."
    structure: |
      The tool name is enclosed in opening and closing tags, and each parameter is similarly enclosed within its own set of tags.
      Adhere strictly to this format for proper parsing and execution.
    example_structure: |
      <tool_name>
      <parameter1_name>value1</parameter1_name>
      <parameter2_name>value2</parameter2_name>
      ...
      </tool_name>
    example_usage: |
      <read_file>
      <path>src/components/Button.tsx</path>
      </read_file>

      Reads file content (optionally specific lines). Handles PDF/DOCX text. Output includes line numbers prefixed to each line (e.g., "1 | import { useStore } from 'zustand'").
      Use this to get the exact current content and line numbers of a file before planning modifications.
      Efficient streaming for line ranges. May not suit other binary files.

          </list_code_definition_names>

  # --- File Modification ---
  - name: apply_diff
    description: |
      Applies precise, surgical modifications to a file by replacing existing content with new content using one or more SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.
      This is the primary tool for editing existing files while maintaining correct indentation and formatting.
      The content in the SEARCH section MUST exactly match the existing content in the file, including all whitespace, indentation, and line breaks.
      Consolidate multiple intended changes to the *same file* into a *single* 'apply_diff' call by concatenating multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks within the 'diff' parameter string.
      Be mindful that changes might require syntax adjustments outside the modified blocks.
      Base path for files is '[F:\roo-roooooling]'.
      CRITICAL ESCAPING RULE: If the literal text '<<<<<<< SEARCH', '=======', or '>>>>>>> REPLACE' appears within the content you need to put inside the SEARCH or REPLACE sections, it MUST be escaped. See the 'diff' parameter description for exact escaping rules.
    parameters:
      - name: path
        required: true
        description: The path of the file to modify (relative to '[F:\roo-roooooling]').
      - name: diff
        required: true
        description: |
          A string containing one or more concatenated SEARCH/REPLACE blocks defining the changes.
          Each block MUST adhere to the following format exactly:
          <<<<<<< SEARCH
          :start_line:[start_line_number]
          :end_line:[end_line_number]
          -------
          [Exact content to find, including whitespace and line breaks]
          =======
          [New content to replace with]
          >>>>>>> REPLACE

          - ':start_line:' and ':end_line:' are required and specify the line numbers (1-based, inclusive) of the original content block being targeted.
          - Use exactly one '=======' separator between the SEARCH and REPLACE content *within each block's structure*.

          *** IMPORTANT ESCAPING RULE ***
          If the literal text of any of the diff markers themselves needs to be part of the [Exact content to find] or [New content to replace], you MUST escape it by prepending a backslash (\) at the beginning of the line where the marker appears *within the content*. This applies ONLY to these specific markers when found inside the content blocks:
            \<<<<<<< SEARCH
            \=======
            \>>>>>>> REPLACE
          Failure to escape these markers when they appear *as content* will cause the diff application to fail. The structural markers (the ones defining the block) should NOT be escaped.
    usage_format: |
      <apply_diff>
      <path>File path here</path>
      <diff>
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      :start_line:start_line_num
      :end_line:end_line_num
      -------
      [Exact content to find - escape internal markers if necessary]
      =======
      [New content to replace with - escape internal markers if necessary]
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
      (Optional: Concatenate additional SEARCH/REPLACE blocks here)
      </diff>
      </apply_diff>
    examples:
      - description: Replace a zustand store function implementation
        usage: |
          <apply_diff>
          <path>src/store/userStore.ts</path>
          <diff>
          <<<<<<< SEARCH
          :start_line:10
          :end_line:15
          -------
          getUser: async (id: string) => {
            // ...
          },
          =======
          getUser: async (id: string) => {
            // updated implementation
          },
          >>>>>>> REPLACE
          </diff>
          </apply_diff>

  - name: write_to_file
    description: |
      Writes full content to a file, overwriting if exists, creating if not (including directories).
      Use for new files or complete rewrites.
      CRITICAL: Provide COMPLETE file content. No partial updates or placeholders. Include ALL parts, modified or not. Do not include line numbers in content.
    parameters:
      - name: path
        required: true
        description: Relative path to file (relative to [F:\roo-roooooling]).
      - name: content
        required: true
        description: Complete file content (use `|` for multiline).
      - name: line_count
        required: true
        description: The number of lines in the file. Compute this based on the actual content of the file you are providing.
    usage_format: |
      <write_to_file>
      <path>File path here</path>
      <content>
      Complete content...
      </content>
      <line_count>Total line count of the content</line_count>
      </write_to_file>
    examples:
      - description: Create a new zustand store file
        usage: |
          <write_to_file>
          <path>src/store/userStore.ts</path>
          <content>
          import create from 'zustand'
          // ...store implementation
          </content>
          <line_count>10</line_count>
          </write_to_file>

implementation_guidelines:
  - All files must be written in TypeScript.
  - Each file must not exceed 500 lines of code.
  - Only one class per file is allowed.
  - Strictly separate frontend and backend logic/calls.
  - Use zustand for all state/data management and API calls (no direct fetch/axios in components).
  - UI components must use either shadcn or Chakra UI.
  - Follow best practices for scalable Next.js apps.
  - Use clear and consistent naming conventions.
  - Prioritize maintainability and modularity.
  - Never try to start the server with npm or any similar command; always ask first if the server is already running before proceeding with any server-dependent tasks.
