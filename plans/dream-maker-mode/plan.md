# Advanced Dream Maker Mode - Comprehensive Project Blueprint Generator

## Overview

The Dream Maker mode is an enhanced derivative of the existing Coconut-Dreamaker mode, designed to automatically generate, organize, and document comprehensive project blueprints by systematically creating all architectural specifications, design documents, implementation details, configuration files, and related project artifacts in a structured plans/{planName} directory hierarchy.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Automatic Documentation Hierarchy Generation
- **Technical Architecture Documents**: System design, component diagrams, data flow specifications
- **API Specifications**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, endpoint definitions, request/response schemas
- **Database Schemas**: Entity relationship diagrams, table structures, migration scripts
- **Deployment Guides**: Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, environment configurations
- **Testing Strategies**: Unit test plans, integration test specifications, performance testing guidelines

### 2. Project Type Specialization
- **Web Applications**: Frontend-focused templates with UI/UX specifications, responsive design, and accessibility guidelines
- **API Services**: Backend service templates with OpenAPI specs, authentication, and scalability considerations
- **Full-Stack Applications**: End-to-end templates combining frontend and backend with integration patterns
- **Mobile Applications**: Platform-specific templates for iOS/Android with app store deployment guides
- **Desktop Applications**: Native desktop templates with platform integration and distribution strategies
- **Data Pipeline/ETL**: Data processing templates with orchestration, monitoring, and quality validation
- **Machine Learning/AI**: ML lifecycle templates with model training, deployment, and monitoring
- **DevOps/Infrastructure**: Infrastructure automation templates with CI/CD and monitoring

### 3. Structured Project Blueprint Organization
