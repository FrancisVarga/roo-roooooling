## Blockers and Risks

### Current Blockers
- None identified at this time

### Identified Risks
1. **Template Complexity**: Risk of over-engineering template system
   - Mitigation: Start simple, iterate based on user feedback
2. **Performance Concerns**: Large documentation generation may be slow
   - Mitigation: Implement incremental generation and caching
3. **User Experience**: Complex features may overwhelm users
   - Mitigation: Progressive disclosure and guided workflows

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Blueprint generation time: < 5 minutes for standard projects
- Documentation completeness: > 95% coverage of critical aspects
- User adoption: Positive feedback from initial users
- Performance: No significant impact on system responsiveness

### Qualitative Metrics
- Documentation quality meets professional standards
- Seamless integration with existing workflows
- Intuitive user experience and navigation
- Comprehensive coverage of project requirements

## Notes and Observations

### Key Insights
- Existing Coconut-Dreamaker provides excellent foundation for enhancement
- Structured directory approach will significantly improve organization
- Automated template generation will save substantial time
- Integration with Memory Bank system is crucial for context preservation

### Lessons Learned
- Comprehensive planning upfront reduces implementation complexity
- User feedback early in process is essential for success
- Incremental development approach reduces risk
- Documentation quality is as important as functionality
