- [x] Create comprehensive project plan
- [x] Design mode architecture and capabilities
- [ ] Create mode configuration in .roomodes
- [ ] Set up initial project structure

### Completed Items
- [2025-05-28 07:05:00] - Created comprehensive project plan document
- [2025-05-28 07:05:00] - Defined core capabilities and technology stack
- [2025-05-28 07:05:00] - Designed architecture patterns and workflows

### Next Steps
1. Create the mode configuration in .roomodes file
2. Set up basic project structure and templates
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation

## Key Decisions Made

### [2025-05-28 07:01:00] - Mode Name and Focus
**Decision**: Named the mode "Coconut-DevOps-Pro" with focus on advanced DevOps capabilities
**Rationale**: Extends existing DevOps mode with specialized Kubernetes, ECS, and Ansible capabilities
**Impact**: Clear positioning as an advanced infrastructure management mode

### [2025-05-28 07:02:00] - Multi-Registry Support
**Decision**: Implement support for GitHub Container Registry, AWS ECR, and Docker Hub
**Rationale**: Provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios and organizational preferences
**Impact**: Requires more complex authentication and configuration management

### [2025-05-28 07:02:00] - Unified Deployment Approach
**Decision**: Create unified deployment commands across all platforms
**Rationale**: Simplifies user experience and reduces learning curve
**Impact**: Requires abstraction layer and platform-specific implementations

## Risks and Mitigation

### Current Risks
1. **Complexity Management**: Risk of creating overly complex workflows
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple templates and gradually enhance
   - **Status**: Monitoring

2. **Platform Integration**: Risk of integration issues across different platforms
   - **Mitigation**: Thorough testing and validation procedures
   - **Status**: Planning

3. **Learning Curve**: Risk of overwhelming users with too many options
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and guided workflows
   - **Status**: Planning

## Success Metrics

### Target Metrics
- **Deployment Time Reduction**: 70% compared to manual processes
- **Deployment Success Rate**: 99.9% across all platforms
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: 100% of production deployments
- **User Adoption**: 80% of team members using the mode within 3 months

### Current Metrics
- **Planning Completion**: 100%
- **Mode Configuration**: 0%
- **Template Creation**: 0%
- **Testing Coverage**: 0%

## Resources and Dependencies

### Required Tools and Technologies
- Kubernetes cluster access
- AWS account with ECS permissions
- Ansible installation and configuration
- Docker and container registry access
